# === Document describing radio noise

- [ITU-R P. 372-4](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-P.372/en) by *International Telecommunication Union* (ITU)

# === Scope of the document and relevant sources of radio noise

The document contains data on radio noise sources for the wave frequencies of ***0.1 Hz*** to ***100 GHz***, covering frequencies used in wireless communication. The main sources of radio noise were identified as:

- ***lower atmosphere temperature***
- ***galaxy***
- ***atmospheric discharge***
- ***man-made sources***

The above sources include eg. *hydrometeors*, *objects in the way of the signal beam*, *extraterrestial radiation* and *radiation from atmospheric discharge*.

The noise generated by the above sources is classified by the ***noise temperature*** and ***noise coefficient***, in order to ptovide comparative criteria for wireless networks solutions.

# === Noise temperature and noise coefficient

## --- Noise temperature

It's a measurement of ***electromagnetic signal interference*** measured in Kelvins. It is described as a temperature in which a respective *Johnson-Nyquist noise* would be created according to the equation:

\[
\begin{equation}
\frac{P_N}{B} = k_BT
\end{equation}
\]

where:
- $P_N$ - noise strength [$N$];
- $B$ - bandwidth in which the noise is measured [$Hz$];
- $k_B$ - Boltzman's constant [$1.381 * 10^{-23} \frac{J}{K}$];
- $T$ - noise temperature [$K$];

## --- Noise coefficient

It's a measurement of ***signal degradation***. It is measured in the dB difference between the noise produced by given receiver and an ideal receiver with the same gain and bandwidth at a **standard noise temperature** (usually ***290 K***).

# === Atmospheric noise

It's an interference caused by atmospheric discharge. It is ***not a Gaussian function***. The probability density function can prove important in determining the efficiency of digital systems. ***Amplitude Probability Distribution*** (APD) of this kind of noise is described as ***voltage deviation*** ($V_d$), defined as ***the ratio*** of the ***root mean square voltage*** to the ***mean voltage*** of the ***noise envelope***. APD curves can be used over a wide range of frequencies.

\[
\begin{equation}
V_d = \frac{V_{RMS}}{V_{mean}}
\end{equation}
\]

where:
- $V_d$ - voltage deviation;
- $V_{RMS}$ - root mean square of voltage;
- $V_{mean}$ - mean voltage of the noise envelope;
